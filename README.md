<h2>Project Description</h2>

MENTCARE AI is an advanced AI-driven platform designed for early detection and ongoing monitoring of multiple mental and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease, Depression, Parkinson’s Disease, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. The system integrates multimodal data from clinical, imaging, wearable devices, and behavioral inputs, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning and explainable AI techniques to support healthcare professionals with precise, interpretable diagnostics.

<h2>Features</h2>
    • Alzheimer’s Disease Detection: Combines MRI brain imaging and physiological data from wearable devices to predict early-stage Alzheimer’s using CNN+SVM and Random Forest models.
    <br>
    • Parkinson’s Disease Screening: Collects gait, motor, and vocal biomarker data analyzed through CNN-LSTM and SVM/deep learning classifiers to estimate Parkinson’s likelihood. <br>
    • Autism Spectrum Disorder Assessment: Analyzes video-based facial expressions and eye gaze with CNNs alongside behavioral logs using decision trees or gradient boosting to evaluate ASD risk.<br>
    • Depression Analysis: Uses text-based BERT analysis and facial emotion recognition via CNN to assess depression risk and severity with multimodal fusion techniques.<br><br>
